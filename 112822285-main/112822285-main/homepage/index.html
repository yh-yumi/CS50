                    They also had highly developed senses of self-preservation. This means that Slytherins tended to hesitate before
                    acting, so as to weigh all possible outcomes before deciding exactly what should be done.</h4>

                      to be academically motivated and talented students. They also prided themselves on being original in their
                      ideas, and methods. It was not unusual to find Ravenclaw students practising especially different types of
                      magic that other houses might shun. Hermione Granger, an extremely intelligent witch and the top student
                      in her year, was sorted into Gryffindor, though she admitted that the Sorting Hat had seriously considered
                      placing her in Ravenclaw.</h4>

                    It might be that due to their values, Hufflepuffs were not as competitive as the other houses, and were more modest
                    about their accomplishments. Hufflepuff was the most inclusive among the four houses; valuing hard work, dedication,
                    patience, loyalty, and fair play rather than a particular aptitude in its students</h4>
