            <div class="paragraph"><h6>Should he write it down? That was the question running through his mind. He couldn't
                  believe what had just happened and he knew nobody else would believe him as well. Even if he
                  documented what had happened by writing it down, he still didn't believe anyone would still
                  believe it. So the question remained. Was it be worth it to actually write it down? The trail to the left had
                  a "Danger! Do Not Pass" sign telling people to take the trail to the
                  right. This wasn't the way Zeke approached his hiking. Rather than a warning.Josh had spent year and year
                  accumulating the information. He knew it inside out and if there was ever anyone looking for an expert
                  in the field, Josh would be the one to call. The problem was that there was nobody interested in the
                  information besides him and he knew it. Years of information painstakingly memorized and sorted with
                  not a sole giving even an ounce of interest in the topic.
                  shited to the right, Zeke slipped past the danger sign to begin an adventure he would later regret.</h6></div>

              strawberries, but it also included blueberries, raspberries, grapes, and banana slices.
              This was the meal Sarah had every morning to start her day since she could remember. Why she
              decided to add chocolate as an option today was still a bit of a surprise, but she had been
              in the process of deciding she wanted to change her routine. This was a baby step to begin that
              start.All he wanted was a candy bar. It didn't seem like a difficult request to
              comprehend, but the clerk remained frozen and didn't seem to want to honor the request. It might
              have had something to do with the gun pointed at his face.
              She needed glasses. It wasn't that she couldn't see without them, but what she could see with them.
              When she wore glasses, her eyes focused so deeply that she could see not only the physical but also
              beyond. It was like a superpower. But she needed glasses.He had done everything right.

                  shited to the right, Zeke slipped past the danger sign to begin an adventure he would later regret.There wasn't a whole lot he could do at that moment. He played the situation again and again in his head
                  looking at what he might have done differently to make the situation better. No matter how many times he
                  relived the situation in his head, there was never really a good alternative course of action. There

                  she didn't really want to hear the answer. It was a no-win situation since she already knew.

          <p>Dave found joy in the daily routine of life.
          He awoke at the same time, ate the same breakfast and drove the same commute. He worked at a job that never seemed to
          change and he got home at 6 pm sharp every night. It was who he had been for the last ten years and he had no idea
          that was all about to change.
          Bryan had made peace with himself and felt comfortable with the choices he made. This had made all the difference in
          the world. Being alone no longer bothered him and this was essential since there was a good chance he might spend
          the rest of his life alone in a cell.
          After hunting for several hours, we finally saw a large seal sunning itself on a flat rock. I took one of the wooden
          clubs while Larry took the longer one. We slowly snuck up behind the seal until we were close enough to club it over
          its head. The seal slumped over and died. This seal would help us survive. We could eat the meat and fat. The fat
      could be burned in a shell for light and the fur could be used to make a blanket.She's asked the question so many times
      that she barely listened to the answers anymore. The answers were always the same. Well, not exactly the same, but the
      same in a general sense. A more accurate description was the answers never surprised her. So, she asked for the 10,000th
      time, "What's your favorite animal?" But this time was different. When she heard the young boy's answer, she wondered
      if she had heard him correctly.She reached her goal, exhausted. Even more chilling to her was that the euphoria that
      she thought she'd feel upon reaching it wasn't there. Something wasn't right. Was this the only feeling she'd have for
      over five years of hard work?She's asked the question so many times that she barely listened to the answers anymore.
      The answers were always the same.</p>
