          <div class="spell_card">Accio<p>
            Summons an object towards the caster. It is able to summon objects in direct line of sight of the caster, as
            well as things out of view, by calling the object aloud after the incantation (unless the spell is casted nonverbally).
            This spell needs thought behind it, and the object must be clear in the casters mind before trying to summon it.

          <div class="spell_card">Alohomora

              it is possible to bewitch doors to become unaffected by this spell.

          <div class="curse_spell">Avada-Kedavra
            <p>
            Causes instantaneous death. It is accompanied by a flash of green light and a rushing noise.
            There is no known Counter-curse that can protect the victim from dying, except for a loving sacrifice.
            It is one of the three Unforgivable Curses.

          <div class="protective_spells">Expecto Patronum
            <p>
              The Patronus Charm (Expecto Patronum) was the most famous and one of the most powerful defensive
              charms known to wizardkind. It was an immensely complicated and extremely difficult spell, that
              channelled the caster's positive emotions into a powerful protection and evoked a partially-tangible
              positive energy force known as a Patronus (pl. Patronuses) or spirit guardian. It was the primary
              protection against Dementors and Lethifolds, against which there were no other defences.
          </p>
          </div>
          <div class="spell_card">Wingardium Leviosa
            <p>The Levitation Charm is one of the first spells learnt by any young witch or wizard. With the
              charm a witch or wizard can make things fly with the flick of a wand. The charm is an excellent
              test of your magical skills, wand control and above all, patience.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="spell_card">Expelliarmus
            <p>The Disarming Charm, as the name implies, enables the user to disarm another wizard or witch
              in a duel by forcing their wand out of their hand. With enough power behind it, the spell could
              also knock an opponent off their feet and send them flying.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="curse_spell">Crucio
            <p>
              The Cruciatus Curse (Crucio), also known as the Torture Curse, was a tool of the Dark Arts
              and one of the three Unforgivable Curses. When cast successfully on a fellow human being or living
              creature, the curse inflicted intense, excruciating physical pain on the victim, and would result in
              insanity if the victim was subjected to it for a prolonged time. The penalty for the use of this curse
              on another human being was a life sentence in Azkaban, unless there was sufficient enough evidence
              that the caster did so under the influence of the Imperius Curse.
          </p>
